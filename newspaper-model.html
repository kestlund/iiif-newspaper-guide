<h1>IIIF Newspaper Model</h1>
<p>This model was designed by the <a href="http://iiif.io/community/groups/newspapers/">IIIF newspapers community group</a>. This document describes the current thinking on modeling Newspapers in IIIF. This model was discussed and documented in the first <a href="http://bit.ly/iiif_ghent_newspaperig">newspaper interest group meeting in Ghent</a>. <em>The goal is not to create yet another newspaper model but to find where there may be issues of differences of definition that will cause problems with interoperability and IIIF.</em></p>
<p>For a description of the IIIF classes please see the Presentation API (http://iiif.io/api/presentation). The minimum set of levels for a IIIF Newspaper is Collection, Issue and Page.</p>

<a name="summarytitle" /><h3>Summary Title / Collection Title / Curated Title / Collection</h3>
<p>Local aggregation often used to group like titles for user access and avoid the trappings of succeeding, preceding, and title variants in serials cataloging that can make using digital newspapers disorienting.<br /> Note: not equivalent to a Uniform Title.</p>
<a name="title" /><h3>Title</h3>
<p>A collection of Newspaper issues that are grouped together to form a single publication. Newspapers can change names and publishers but this grouping would link issues into a single publication. Traditionally linked to the $245 in a MARC catalog record.</p>
<a name="volume" /><h3>Volume</h3>
<p>A collection of issues which are gathered together, typically in physical form. This historically has been used for issues that are published in a particular year. Note date based volumes like collections of issues published in a year could be created by a viewer using the <strong>NavDate</strong> for an issue, so a volume designation may not be necessary or only serve provenance purposes.  
<br />Note: incorrect volumes may or may not be corrected in metadata. </p>
<a name="issue" /><h3>Issue</h3>
<p>The collection of pages that were published at a particular issuance. Multiple issues of the same Newspaper can be published on the same date. Note: incorrect issues may or may not be corrected in metadata. Some implementations may treat supplements as issues published on the same date as the issue it is associated with.</p>
<a name="edition" /><h3>Edition</h3>
<p>The textual label of the edition on the piece. Editions vary widely by newspaper and region and may include examples such as: &quot;Late Edition,&quot; &quot;Morning Edition,&quot; &quot;Special Edition,&quot; &quot;Weekend Early
<a name="section" /><h3>Section</h3>
<p>A section within a Newspaper Issue for example sports section or supplement included in the Edition,&quot; &quot;East Side&quot;, and &quot;West Side.&quot; Use the <strong>NavDate</strong> for presentation flow and edition order (e.g. from morning to late editions).</p> Newspaper. </p>
<a name="page" /><h3>Page</h3>
<p>A page, insert, foldout or other &quot;piece&quot; of a Newspaper that is digitized as a single image. &quot;Pages&quot; may link to &quot;Page text&quot; or other annotations. </p>
<a name="pagetext" /><h3>Page text</h3>
<p>The text contained within a page usually generated by running optical character recognition software on a newspaper image. This can have coordinates associated with the text to allow a bounding box to be placed on the image where the text appears. Page text can be available at multiple granularities including article, paragraph, line, word and character.  The page text may be provided as an Annotation list, or as <strong>seeAlso</strong> link to an ALTO file. Examples are provided below.</p>
<p>The IIIF Text Granularity Working Group is investigating options for consensus on different levels of text for the same annotation.</p>
<h3>Articles and Illustrations</h3>
<a name="articles" /><p>A collection of text areas on a page that are related. Examples include News article, advertising, family notices, cartoons etc. In the current model articles can cross pages but not issues. Articles have text and coordinates which highlight the areas of a page which relate to an article. Articles can have metadata like title, author or type.  </p>
<a name="supplements" /><h3>Supplements</h3>
<p>Supplements come in a variety of forms for newspapers. Local practice and a particular instance will determine if supplements should be treated as their own issue and a manifest or a range within an issue.</p>
